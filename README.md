## Running the Exercises in Expo Snack

You can run each exercise directly in Expo Snack to test it on different platforms.

1. Open the exercise folder you want to run.
2. Copy its contents into a new Expo Snack.
3. **Delete the `index.js` file** from the exercise folder after importing into Snack.
   * Snack expects the entry point to be `App.js`, so keeping `index.js` will cause errors.
4. If Expo Snack suggests updating the SDK (to SDK 5.4.0), accept the update.
5. Run and test the app on.
